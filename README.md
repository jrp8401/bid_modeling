The data comes from a spreadhsheet maintaied by the estimators. Due to this I anticpated the data to have some mistakes and upon my initial EDA I noticed emppty values in the spreadsheet. I was able to fill out some missign data based on other information in the spreadsheet The features that were availible for almost every project was Project Description, City, Electricans Guild, Project Type, Bid Type, Design Type, Estimator, Department, Bid amount and the Result of the bid.
